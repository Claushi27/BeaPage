                            Born in 2001 in Chile, I've always been a loving person. I had a good life, but I never imagined I'd fall in love with someone from the other side of the world. Every step I took was bringing me closer to you.

                        <p>
                            Born in 2004 near Manila, Bea grew up surrounded by a big, loving family. Even though she only had her father and doesn't have many childhood photos, she was raised with so much love. Her father was strict, but that made her the strong, beautiful woman she is today. She's studying nursing and one day, she made the best decision of her life - she downloaded Bumpy hahaha 💕

                        <p>We met on Bumpy - an app to meet people from around the world. You're from the Philippines, I'm from Chile. From the moment I saw you, I knew you were special. Not just because you were the most beautiful, but because of that smile that made me feel something I'd never felt before.</p>
                        <p>After we started talking and I asked for your Instagram, I was sure - you were truly special. From that first day, I just wanted to focus on you. 💕</p>

                        <p>But then you told me you wanted to learn Spanish... and I knew it was just an excuse to talk to me more 💕. Getting back in touch with you was the BEST decision I ever made. After that, everything felt different. Talking to you felt so easy, so peaceful, so beautiful. 💕</p>

                        <p>I remember when you said you weren't sure about a relationship because you needed to work on yourself - seeing a psychologist, getting to know yourself better. And now look at you! You've grown so much. You know yourself better, and you have me by your side. 💕</p>
                        <p>At first, it was hard for you to open up (which frustrated me a bit, not gonna lie haha), but now you share your feelings so much more with me.</p>
                        <p>I still remember our first fight - how you said sorry and realized what you did wrong. That's when I knew for SURE I wanted you. Communication, honesty, leaving ego aside - being emotionally mature. You showed me all of that, baby. You did it perfectly. 💕</p>

                        <p>Then we started watching One Piece live action together. Every episode, I couldn't stop looking at you. It was the first time I felt this kind of connection - seeing someone so beautiful, so perfect for me.</p>
                        <p>Everything about you was cute: how you enjoyed my favorite series, your eyes full of excitement when you laughed, how you blushed when you caught me staring at you. 💕</p>
                        <p>I fell for you SO fast, baby. And we both know that even though it was quick, it was REAL. It was beautiful. And when we finally meet in person, it's going to be even MORE amazing. 💕</p>

                        <p>Your happiness, how good you are with kids and your family, how you cook, how you're always so happy and calm - everything I've been looking for. 💕</p>
                        <p>I LOVE waking up to a thousand notifications from you - TikToks, Reels, WhatsApp messages with updates about your day. I love that you're always thinking about me, even when I'm sleeping. 💕</p>
                        <p>We share everything - our daily routines, you met my dogs, I met Paris and Isha hahaha. The little words like "ye", "nothing", when you're learning Spanish or teaching me Tagalog - it all feels so beautiful. 💕</p>
